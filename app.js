/**
 * See the documentation for all possible options - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session
 * 
 * As a brief overview (we will add more later): 
 * 
 * secret: This is a random string that will be used to "authenticate" the session.  In a production environment,
 * you would want to set this to a long, randomly generated string
 * 
 * resave: when set to true, this will force the session to save even if nothing changed.  If you don't set this, 
 * the app will still run but you will get a warning in the terminal
 * 
 * saveUninitialized: Similar to resave, when set true, this forces the session to be saved even if it is unitialized
 *
 * store: Sets the MemoryStore to the MongoStore setup earlier in the code.  This makes it so every new session will be 
 * saved in a MongoDB database in a "sessions" table and used to lookup sessions
 * 
 * cookie: The cookie object has several options, but the most important is the `maxAge` property.  If this is not set, 
 * the cookie will expire when you close the browser.  Note that different browsers behave slightly differently with this
 * behaviour (for example, closing Chrome doesn't always wipe out the cookie since Chrome can be configured to run in the
 * background and "remember" your last browsing session)

/**
 * -------------- PASSPORT AUTHENTICATION ----------------
 */

/**
 * Notice that these middlewares are initialized after the `express-session` middleware.  This is because
 * Passport relies on the `express-session` middleware and must have access to the `req.session` object.
 * 
 * passport.initialize() - This creates middleware that runs before every HTTP request.  It works in two steps: 
 *      1. Checks to see if the current session has a `req.session.passport` object on it.  This object will be
 *          
 *          { user: '<Mongo DB user ID>' }
 * 
 *      2.  If it finds a session with a `req.session.passport` property, it grabs the User ID and saves it to an 
 *          internal Passport method for later.
 *  
 * passport.session() - This calls the Passport Authenticator using the "Session Strategy".  Here are the basic
 * steps that this method takes:
 *      1.  Takes the MongoDB user ID obtained from the `passport.initialize()` method (run directly before) and passes
 *          it to the `passport.deserializeUser()` function (defined above in this module).  The `passport.deserializeUser()`
 *          function will look up the User by the given ID in the database and return it.
 *      2.  If the `passport.deserializeUser()` returns a user object, this user object is assigned to the `req.user` property
 *          and can be accessed within the route.  If no user is returned, nothing happens and `next()` is called.
